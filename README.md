<p align="center">A simple tool for unpacking DBPF (.package) files from Darkspore.</p>

## Features  
- Extracts files from `.package` archives used in the game Darkspore.  
- Simplified CLI for unpacking tasks.  

## How to Use  
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/jeanxpereira/recap_Unpacker/releases).  
2. Run the program via command line:  
   ```bash
   ReCap.Unpacker.exe [-d|--debug] <file> <destination>
   ```
- Replace `<file>` with the path to the .package file.
- Replace `<destination>` with the directory where you 
- want to extract the contents.
- Use `-d` or `--debug` for verbose logging if needed.
